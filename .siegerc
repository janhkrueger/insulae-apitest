#
# Get method: Use this directive to select an HTTP method for siege 
# when it's run in get mode, i.e., siege -g/--get URL. You may select
# GET or HEAD. The default method is HEAD. As expected HEAD prints just
# the headers and GET prints the entire page. 
# 
# NOTE: This only applies when siege is invoked with -g/--get. All 
# other requests methods will be made on the basis of the URL. 
# 
# example: gmethod = GET
# 
gmethod = HEAD

#
# Limit: This directive places a cap on the number of threads siege
# will generate. The default value is 255 which corresponds with 
# apache's default value. If you schedule more clients than apache is
# configured to handle, then requests will back up and you will make a
# mess. DO NOT INCREASE THIS NUMBER UNLESS YOU CONFIGURED APACHE TO 
# HANDLE MORE THAN 256 SIMULTANEOUS REQUESTS. 
#
# ex: limit = 1023 (default is 255)
# 
limit = 255

#
# HTTP protocol.  Options HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0. Some webservers have 
# broken implementation of the 1.1 protocol which skews throughput 
# evaluations. If you notice some siege clients hanging for extended
# periods of time, change this to HTTP/1.0
#
# ex: protocol = HTTP/1.1
#     protocol = HTTP/1.0
#
protocol = HTTP/1.1

#
# Session expiration: This directive allows you to delete all cookies 
# after you pass through the URLs. This means siege will grab a new 
# session with each run through its URLs. The default value is false.
#
# ex: expire-session = true
#
# expire-session = 

cookies = false

#
# Failures: This is the number of total connection failures allowed 
# before siege aborts. Connection failures (timeouts, socket failures,
# etc.) are combined with 400 and 500 level errors in the final stats, 
# but those errors do not count against the abort total.  If you set 
# this total to 10, then siege will abort after ten socket timeouts, 
# but it will NOT abort after ten 404s. This is designed to prevent a 
# run-away mess on an unattended siege. 
#
# The default value is 1024
#
# ex: failures = 50

benchmark = false

#
# User-agent: With this directive you can set the siege user-agent The default 
# agent is: JoeDog/1.40 [en] (X11; I; Siege #.##) With this directive, you can 
# mimic various browsers or you can make up something fun. Limey, our English 
# bulldog, was recovering from minor surgery at the time we added this feature
# so we like to dedicate the example in his honor:
#
# ex: user-agent = Limey The Bulldog
